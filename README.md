# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025 Solutions ⭐

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) - a series
of daily programming puzzles released throughout December. 🎅

## About Advent of Code 📖

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety
of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language
you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university
coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

## Structure 📂

```
aoc-2025/
├── README.md
├── day1.ipynb          # Day 1 solution
├── day2.ipynb          # Day 2 solution
├── ...                 # Days 3-25 follow the same pattern
└── data/
    ├── day1-data.txt   # Day 1 puzzle input
    ├── day1-test.txt   # Day 1 test case
    ├── day2-data.txt   # Day 2 puzzle input
    ├── day2-test.txt   # Day 2 test case
    └── ...             # Additional days follow the same pattern
```

## Solutions 🧩

Each day's solution is contained in a Jupyter notebook (`dayN.ipynb`) with:

- Problem description and approach
- Solution code for Part 1 and Part 2
- Test cases and actual puzzle input
- Performance notes and optimizations

### Completed Days ✨

- **Day 1**: [day1.ipynb](day1.ipynb) 🎁
- **Day 2**: [day2.ipynb](day2.ipynb) 🎁
- **Day 3**: [day3.ipynb](day3.ipynb) 🎁
- **Day 4**: [day4.ipynb](day4.ipynb) 🎁
- **Day 5**: [day5.ipynb](day5.ipynb) 🎁
- **Day 6**: [day6.ipynb](day6.ipynb) 🎁

## Running Solutions 🚀

All solutions are implemented in Python using Jupyter notebooks. To run:

1. Open the notebook in VS Code or Jupyter
2. Execute cells sequentially
3. Test data validates the approach before running on actual input

## Notes 📝

- Solutions prioritize clarity and correctness over performance
- Some solutions include multiple approaches (brute force → optimized)
- Test cases are used to validate logic before running on full input
- Comments explain the problem requirements and solution approach

❄️ Happy Coding! 🎄 Help the elves save the holiday season! 🧝‍♂️🧝‍♀️
